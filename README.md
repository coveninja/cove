## Build from source

**Prerequisites:** Go 1.21+, Node.js 20+, Qt 6 with QtWebEngine, libmpv, cmake

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Arcadyi/cove
cd cove
echo "TMDB_API_KEY=your_key_here" > .env
make run  # builds everything and launches the app
```

### Development

```sh
make hot        # hot-reload: Vite HMR in-window, rebuilds Go + Qt on changes
make hot-debug  # same + QtWebEngine remote devtools on :9222
make web-dev    # browser-only Vite dev server (player shows "unavailable")
```

### Individual builds

```sh
make go      # build the Go backend binary
make web     # build the Svelte frontend
make qt      # build the Qt shell
